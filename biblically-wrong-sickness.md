# Biblically WRONG Things Christians Say - Part 1
## “Sickness and disease are not of God / God does not allow sickness”

Many popular preachers hold this view, including Kenneth Copeland, Andrew Wommack, Benny Hinn, Bill Johnson (Bethel Church), Joseph Prince, Joyce Meyer, Creflo Dollar, TD Jakes and Joel Osteen.

This directly contradicts what God Himself has said in His word.
* God afflicted Moses with leprosy. Exodus 4:6
* God told Moses HE is the one who makes people deaf, mute or blind. Exodus 4:11
* God struck the Egyptians with boils and sores during 12 plagues.
* God struck the Israelites with a plage for worshipping the golden calf – Exodus 32:35
* God struck the Israelites with a plague -Numbers 11:33
* God struck Moses’ sister, Miriam, with leprosy – Numbers 12:10
* God promised to send the Israelites “severe and lingering illnesses” - Deuteronomy 28:58-61
* God afflicted the Philistines with tumors – 1 Samuel 5:6-12
* God struck Nabal down after putting him in a coma for 10 days – 1 Samuel 25:37-38
* God struck David and Bathsheba’s child with sickness for 7 days, then death. – 2 Samuel 12:15-18
* God afflicted Elisha’s servant, Gehazi, with leprosy – 2 Kings 5:27
* God struck Uzziah with leprosy – 2 Kings 15:5
* God afflicted Jehoram with “an incurable disease of the bowels.” – 2 Chronicles 21:18
* God afflicted Nebuchadnezzar with insanity – Daniel 4:31-33
* God killed Ananias and Sapphira – Acts 5:1-10
* The Corinthians brought God’s judgment upon themselves resulting in sickness and death – 1 Corinthians 11:29-30
* God struck Herod down – Acts 12:23
* Paul had “an illness” while pastoring the Galatians – Galatians 4:13-14
* Timothy encouraged to drink wine due to stomach issues and frequent illnesses – 1 Timothy 5:23

Bad theology hurts people. This teaching is unbiblical, false and dangerous to the faith of those who might put their hope in something God never said.
