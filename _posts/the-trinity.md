### Overview
The concept of the Trinity is a fundamental doctrine of Christianity. It's also one of the most difficult to wrap our 
heads around, so it becomes the source of a lot of error and misunderstanding.
You may have heard someone say, "You won't find the word Trinity in the Bible"

What is the official orthodoxy about the Trinity? Fundamentally, the doctrine of the Trinity states that God is one 
in essence and three distinct persons; God the Father, God the Son and God the Holy Spirit. All three are co-equal, 
co-eternal and co-existent.
