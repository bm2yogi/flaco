### About {{page.book}}:
The book of Acts was written by Luke, who also authored the Gospel of Luke. Both writings are addressed to Theophilus at the beginning of each. The book of Acts chronicles the events and activities of the apostles and the early church immediately following the crucifixion, resurrection and ascension of Jesus. Because Acts is historical in nature, its lessons can easily be understood by taking it at face value. 

Acts is assumed to have been originally written as early as just 30 years after Jesus ministry on earth, between 62-70 A.D. It stands to reason that a meticulous historian like Luke would have at least included the martyrdom of James (62 A.D.), Peter (64 A.D.), Paul (67 A.D.) or even the destruction of Jerusalem in 70 A.D. Since none of these events are recorded, it is almost certain the authorship took place before these events.

### Background:
The events in Acts 3 take place some time after Jesus' disciples were baptized in the Holy Spirit at Pentecost. At Pentecost, the number of Jews who joined in following Jesus had grown by 3000 in a single day and continued to grow daily as the believers devoted themselves to *"apostlesâ€™ teaching and to fellowship, to the breaking of bread and to prayer."* Jesus is gone now, awaiting His return from heaven. His disciples are busy fulfilling the Great Commission, much to the dismay of the spiritual and political authorities of the day.

### For Discussion:
1. Replay the story in your mind and imagine that you are the beggar. One of the onlookers. Peter. John. What might be going through your mind as these events unfold?
2. Can we reason from scripture that this was probably not the first time Peter and John had seen the beggar? How about Jesus? Do you think He noticed him?
3. Why do you think God may have chosen this moment and this place to perform a miracle and heal this man? Why not anytime before?
4. What do we see that God required of Peter, John or the beggar before the healing would take place?
5. What do you find most remarkable about Peter's response to the onlooking temple worshippers?
6. How does Peter's response to the crowd in verses 12-16 differ from his response in 17-21. Is there any significance to him to delivering the gospel of Jesus in this way?
7. In verse 19, Why is Peter calling on the temple worshippers to repent? What does it mean to repent? Is repentance really required in order to have your sins "wiped out?"
