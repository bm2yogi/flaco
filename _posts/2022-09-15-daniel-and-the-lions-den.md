## Men's Discipleship Bible Study: Week 5
Daniel 6:1-28.
### About the book of Daniel:
The book of Daniel is one of five books in the Old Testament referred to as the Major Prophets. These books are Isaiah, Jeremiah, Lamentations Ezekiel and Daniel. This is in contrast to the 12 books known as the Minor Prophets. The terms major and minor don't refer to the significance of prophets themselves, but rather the books. The prophet Daniel is credited as the author of the book that bears his name. The book of Daniel is both prophetic and historical, chronicling the people, and events surrounding the capture and exile of Israel by the Babylonians in 605 B.C. and later the Medo-Persians in 539 B.C.
### Background:
Daniel was around 15 years of age when he and numerous other young men descended from Israel's nobility were carried off to Babylon following the conquest of Jerusalem. In a culture that worshiped false gods, men, decadence and pleasure, Daniel remained disciplined and faithful to God throughout his life. God granted him favor and Daniel rose to prominence in the Babylonian and Medo-Persian governments. His integrity and wisdom earned him the respect and sometimes ire of his contemporaries.
### For Discussion:
* What stands out to you about this story and why?
* In Daniel 6:5-8, Daniel's enemies conspired to make his devotion to God against the law of the land. Imagine yourself as one of the many other Israelites in the empire at the time? What would be going through your mind? How would you be tempted to respond?
* The king's decree banning prayer was to expire after 30 days. Would the "limited" timeframe tempt you to compromise?
* Observe Daniel's response. What do you think may have gone through Daniel's mind when he heard the king's decree? What do you think enabled Daniel to respond the way he did?
* Could something like that happen today in this country? How would you respond? Why? How can you be sure?
* Consider how each of the events unfolded from King Darius' perspective. What stands out to you?
* What similarities do you see between verses 15-17 and Matthew 27:62-66? What other similarities do you see with the rest of Daniel chapter 6 and the rest of Matthew?
* Compare and contrast King Darius' proclamation (v25-27) with the Great Commission in Matthew 28:18-20.
* In what ways does this story demonstrate God's grace and His message of salvation?
