## Men's Bible Study: Temperance

Temperance is a word whose usage has been on a steep decline since the turn of the 
20th century, but what does it mean? How would you define temperance?

The word temperance was translated from the original Greek word *egkrateia* which comes from the word *kratos*, meaning
power, dominion, strength and might. In more recent translations, the word is "self-control."

### Read and discuss:
> 32 Better a patient person than a warrior, one with self-control than one who takes a city. - Proverbs 16:32 NIV
 
> 28 Like a city whose walls are broken through is a person who lacks self-control. - Proverbs 25:28 NIV

* Who are some people from the Scriptures who exemplified self-control or the lack thereof?
* How did it end for them? What did it ultimately cost them?

### Triggered by the mention:

> 24 Several days later Felix came with his wife Drusilla, who was Jewish. He sent for Paul and listened to him as he spoke about faith in Christ Jesus. 25 As Paul talked about righteousness, ***self-control*** and the judgment to come, Felix was afraid and said, "That's enough for now! You may leave. When I find it convenient, I will send for you." - Acts 24:24-25 NIV

* What is the relationship Paul tries to draw among righteousness, self-control and the judgment to come?
* What do you observe about Felix' response to Paul's message?

### Birthright of the believer:
> 18 But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the law. 19 The acts of the flesh are obvious: sexual immorality, impurity and debauchery; 20 idolatry and witchcraft; hatred, discord, jealousy, fits of rage, selfish ambition, dissensions, factions 21 and envy; drunkenness, orgies, and the like. I warn you, as I did before, that those who live like this will not inherit the kingdom of God. 22 But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, forbearance, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, 23 gentleness and ***self-control***. Against such things there is no law. - Galatians 5:18-23 NIV

>3 His divine power has given us everything we need for a godly life through our knowledge of him who called us by his own glory and goodness. 4 Through these he has given us his very great and precious promises, so that through them you may participate in the divine nature, having escaped the corruption in the world caused by evil desires. 5 For this very reason, make every effort to add to your faith goodness; and to goodness, knowledge; 6 and to knowledge, ***self-control***; and to ***self-control***, perseverance; and to perseverance, godliness; 7 and to godliness, mutual affection; and to mutual affection, love. 8 For if you possess these qualities in increasing measure, they will keep you from being ineffective and unproductive in your knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ. 9 But whoever does not have them is nearsighted and blind, forgetting that they have been cleansed from their past sins. 10 Therefore, my brothers and sisters, make every effort to confirm your calling and election. For if you do these things, you will never stumble, - 2 Peter 1:3-10 NIV

* What do these passages say to the Christian about self-control?
* Why is self-control so hard sometimes?

### When self-control is missing
> 1 But mark this: There will be terrible times in the last days. 2 People will be lovers of themselves, lovers of money, boastful, proud, abusive, disobedient to their parents, ungrateful, unholy, 3 without love, unforgiving, slanderous, ***without self-control***, brutal, not lovers of the good, 4 treacherous, rash, conceited, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God-- 5 having a form of godliness but denying its power. Have nothing to do with such people. - 2 Timothy 3:1-5 NIV

* Which characteristics in this list can exist in the life of someone who also has self-control?
* Is self-control enough to keep these others at bay?

### For More Discussion:
1. What principles do we observe in these passages that we ought to apply and integrate into our lives at home, in the
   church, at work, and in the public square?
2. How do these passages point to the Gospel of Jesus Christ? 
What connections can we draw between self-control and the Gospel of Jesus?
