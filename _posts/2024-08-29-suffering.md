## Men's Bible Study: {{page.title}}

### Overview
One of the questions most often asked of believers goes something like, "Why does God allow suffering?"
Sometimes this question gets asked as a challenge, saying "The presence of evil means God cannot be both good and all powerful.
He either has the power to eliminate evil and chooses not to (therefore He's not good), or He does not have the power
to eliminate evil (therefore He's not all powerful)."

This struggle with suffering deeply affects both believers and non-believers. We all suffer for 
different reasons at different times. But why?

### The Fall
>31 God saw all that he had made, and it was very good. And there was evening, 
> and there was morning--the sixth day. 1 Thus the heavens and the earth were
> completed in all their vast array. 2 By the seventh day God had finished the 
> work he had been doing; so on the seventh day he rested from all his work. 3 
> Then God blessed the seventh day and made it holy, because on it he rested
> from all the work of creating that he had done. - Genesis 1:31 - 2:3 NIV

>16 To the woman he said, "I will make your pains in childbearing very severe; 
> with painful labor you will give birth to children. Your desire will be for 
> your husband, and he will rule over you." 17 To Adam he said, "Because you 
> listened to your wife and ate fruit from the tree about which I commanded you,
> 'You must not eat from it,' "Cursed is the ground because of you; through 
> painful toil you will eat food from it all the days of your life. 18 It will 
> produce thorns and thistles for you, and you will eat the plants of the field.
> 19 By the sweat of your brow you will eat your food until you return to the
> ground, since from it you were taken; for dust you are and to dust you will 
> return." - Genesis 3:16-19 NIV

These passages in Genesis remind us that suffering entered the world as a result of the
sin of Adam and his wife, Eve. Suffering is a consequence of both living in a fallen world
as well as a consequence of our decision to reject the instructions of our God.

### Not all suffering is because of our sin...

> 18 "If the world hates you, keep in mind that it hated me first. 19 If you belonged to the world, it would love you as its own. As it is, you do not belong to the world, but I have chosen you out of the world. That is why the world hates you. 20 Remember what I told you: 'A servant is not greater than his master.' If they persecuted me, they will persecute you also. If they obeyed my teaching, they will obey yours also. 21 They will treat you this way because of my name, for they do not know the one who sent me. - John 15:18-21 NIV

>12 In fact, everyone who wants to live a godly life in Christ Jesus will be persecuted, 13 while evildoers and impostors will go from bad to worse, deceiving and being deceived. - 2 Timothy 3:12-13 NIV

We live in a world that is not only fallen, but hostile to God and His people. Christ and the apostles warned
us that we would suffer at the hands of people who hate us because we are His. We should
remind ourselves that our peace and comfort is not the mission, but the reward.

### Suffering prepares us for God's work
>6 In all this you greatly rejoice, though now for a little while you may have had to suffer grief in all kinds of trials. 7 These have come so that the proven genuineness of your faith--of greater worth than gold, which perishes even though refined by fire--may result in praise, glory and honor when Jesus Christ is revealed. - 1 Peter 1:6-7 NIV

>2 Consider it pure joy, my brothers and sisters, whenever you face trials of many kinds, 3 because you know that the testing of your faith produces perseverance. 4 Let perseverance finish its work so that you may be mature and complete, not lacking anything. - James 1:2-4 NIV

>3 Praise be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of compassion and the God of all comfort, 4 who comforts us in all our troubles, so that we can comfort those in any trouble with the comfort we ourselves receive from God. 5 For just as we share abundantly in the sufferings of Christ, so also our comfort abounds through Christ. - 2 Corinthians 1:3-5 NIV

Struggling and suffering is how we get stronger. God allows us to temporarily go through 
pain and suffering because He knows it will strengthen us and prepare us for His good works.

### Suffering now, sharing in His glory later
>16 The Spirit himself testifies with our spirit that we are God's children. 17 Now if we are children, then we are heirs--heirs of God and co-heirs with Christ, if indeed we share in his sufferings in order that we may also share in his glory. 18 I consider that our present sufferings are not worth comparing with the glory that will be revealed in us. 19 For the creation waits in eager expectation for the children of God to be revealed. - Romans 8:16-19 NIV

>12 Dear friends, do not be surprised at the fiery ordeal that has come on you to test you, as though something strange were happening to you. 13 But rejoice inasmuch as you participate in the sufferings of Christ, so that you may be overjoyed when his glory is revealed. - 1 Peter 4:12-13 NIV

### God is Sovereign
>8 "For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways," declares the LORD. 9 "As the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts. - Isaiah 55:8-9 NIV

We won't always know why or when or for how much longer. There's a strong temptation to 
want God to hurry up and get it over with. Things may not always go how we want them to. 
There's a strong temptation to kick at the trials. We should remind ourselves that God
is always on top of it. He has already worked this out for His glory and is waiting for us 
at the other end of our trial. We just haven't caught up with Him yet. It will all make sense 
once we see it in the rear-view mirror.
