## Men's Bible Study: {{page.title}}

### Overview:
Christians often ask or wonder how to know God's will for their life. What is it that God wants and intends for us to do? 
What choices does he want us to make? We're often uncertain with the future and can sometimes be concerned about making 
the wrong decision. If we're not careful, this can lead us into fear, uncertainty and decision paralysis. In worse cases, 
it makes us vulnerable to seeking and receiving direction from the wrong sources, sometimes well-meaning or sometimes
not-so-well-meaning.

As a follower of Christ, our primary and ultimate authority about our life's decisions should be God and God alone. 
He has revealed to us His will through His word as recorded and preserved for us in the Scriptures. Let's take a look at 
what they have to say about God's will.

The following is a sample of scriptures in which the will of God is specifically referenced, however the gospels and epistles
have more teaching on what God's will for our lives than can be reasonably included here. I encourage you to do a deep dive
into the passages listed here in your personal study.

Micah, prophesying to a rebellious Israel, reminding them God's will has long been made clear to them:
> 8 He has shown you, O mortal, what is good. And what does the LORD require of you? To act justly and to love mercy and to walk humbly with your God. - Micah 6:8 NIV

Moses, speaking to the Israelites regarding the Law and their Covenant with God:
> 29 The secret things belong to the LORD our God, but the things revealed belong to us and to our children forever, that we may follow all the words of this law. - Deuteronomy 29:29 NIV

Jesus, speaking to believers and Pharisees:
> 38 "For I have come down from heaven not to do my will but to do the will of him who sent me. 39 And **this is the will of him who sent me**, that I shall lose none of all those he has given me, but raise them up at the last day. 40 For **my Father's will is** that everyone who looks to the Son and believes in him shall have eternal life, and I will raise them up at the last day." - John 6:38-40 NIV

Paul's opening remarks to the church in Galatia:
> 3 Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ, 4 who gave himself for our sins to rescue us from the present evil age, according to **the will of our God and Father**, - Galatians 1:3-4 NIV

Paul's opening remarks to the church in Ephesus:
> 5 He predestined us for adoption to sonship through Jesus Christ, **in accordance with his pleasure and will**-- ... 9 **he made known to us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure**, which he purposed in Christ, - Ephesians 1:5, 9 NIV

Paul's letter to the church in Ephesus (Paul spends the rest of the letter providing specific instructions on God's will):
> 17 Therefore do not be foolish, but **understand what the Lord's will is**. 18 Do not get drunk on wine, which leads to debauchery. Instead, be filled with the Spirit, 19 speaking to one another with psalms, hymns, and songs from the Spirit. Sing and make music from your heart to the Lord, 20 always giving thanks to God the Father for everything, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. 21 Submit to one another out of reverence for Christ. 22 Wives, submit yourselves to your own husbands as you do to the Lord. ... 25 Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her - Ephesians 5:17-22, 25 NIV

Paul's opening remarks to the church in Colosse:
> 9 For this reason, since the day we heard about you, we have not stopped praying for you. We continually **ask God to fill you with the knowledge of his will** through all the wisdom and understanding that the Spirit gives, - Colossians 1:9 NIV

Paul's letter to the church in Thessalonica:
> 3 **It is God's will** that you should be sanctified: that you should avoid sexual immorality; 4 that each of you should learn to control your own body in a way that is holy and honorable, ... 7 For God did not call us to be impure, but to live a holy life. - 1 Thessalonians 4:3-4, 7 NIV

> 16 Rejoice always, 17 pray continually, 18 give thanks in all circumstances; for **this is God's will for you** in Christ Jesus. - 1 Thessalonians 5:16-18 NIV

Peter's letter to the church scattered across Asia Minor:
> 11 Dear friends, I urge you, as foreigners and exiles, to abstain from sinful desires, which wage war against your soul. 12 Live such good lives among the pagans that, though they accuse you of doing wrong, they may see your good deeds and glorify God on the day he visits us. 13 Submit yourselves for the Lord's sake to every human authority: whether to the emperor, as the supreme authority, 14 or to governors, who are sent by him to punish those who do wrong and to commend those who do right. 15 **For it is God's will** that by doing good you should silence the ignorant talk of foolish people. 16 Live as free people, but do not use your freedom as a cover-up for evil; live as God's slaves. 17 Show proper respect to everyone, love the family of believers, fear God, honor the emperor. 18 Slaves, in reverent fear of God submit yourselves to your masters, not only to those who are good and considerate, but also to those who are harsh. - 1 Peter 2:11-18 NIV

> 19 So then, those who **suffer according to God's will** should commit themselves to their faithful Creator and continue to do good. - 1 Peter 4:19 NIV

Jesus, giving final instructions to His disciples after His resurrection:
> 18 Then Jesus came to them and said, "All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me. 19 Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, 20 and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you. And surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age." - Matthew 28:18-20 NIV

### For Discussion:
1. What can we observe from these passages about what God wants for Himself?
2. What can we observe from these passages about what God wants from us?
3. What does the scripture tell us about the transparency with which God reveals his will for our lives?
4. In light of what we've learnt, what do we do now?
