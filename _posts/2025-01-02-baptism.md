## Men's Bible Study: Baptism

### Introduction
Baptism is one of the most significant practices in the Christian faith. It is rich in meaning, rooted in Scripture, and integral to the gospel message. This study will cover:
* The Origin of Baptism
* The Purpose of Baptism
* Its Role in Salvation
* Its Significance in the Gospel Message

### The Origin of Baptism
#### Old Testament Roots
Ceremonial Washings: In the Old Testament, ceremonial washings symbolized purification and cleansing (e.g., Leviticus 16:4, Numbers 19:7).
The Red Sea: Paul connects the Israelites passing through the Red Sea to a type of baptism (1 Corinthians 10:1-2).
#### John the Baptist

Matthew 3:1-6: John baptized people as a sign of repentance, preparing the way for Jesus. His baptism symbolized turning from sin but pointed to the greater baptism Jesus would bring.
#### Jesus’ Baptism

Matthew 3:13-17: Jesus was baptized to "fulfill all righteousness." His baptism marked the beginning of His public ministry and affirmed His identity as God’s Son.

### The Purpose of Baptism
#### Public Declaration of Faith

Acts 2:38-41: At Pentecost, those who accepted Peter’s message were baptized, publicly declaring their faith in Christ.
Romans 6:3-4: Baptism symbolizes identification with Christ’s death, burial, and resurrection.
#### Obedience to Christ’s Command

Matthew 28:19-20: Jesus commanded His disciples to baptize in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, making baptism an act of obedience.
#### Spiritual Cleansing

Acts 22:16: "And now what are you waiting for? Get up, be baptized and wash your sins away, calling on his name."
Baptism represents the cleansing power of Christ’s sacrifice.
### Discussion Question:

How does baptism act as both a declaration and an act of obedience?
### The Role of Baptism in Salvation
#### Baptism as a Symbol

Ephesians 2:8-9: Salvation is by grace through faith, not by works, including baptism. Baptism does not save but demonstrates faith.
#### Baptism as an Expression of Faith

Mark 16:16: "Whoever believes and is baptized will be saved, but whoever does not believe will be condemned."
Baptism is closely tied to belief, acting as an outward expression of an inward reality.
#### Baptism in the Early Church

Acts 8:35-38: The Ethiopian eunuch believed and was immediately baptized, showing the close relationship between faith and baptism.
### Discussion Question:

How do we reconcile the role of faith and baptism in salvation?
### The Significance of Baptism in the Gospel Message
#### Unity in Christ

Galatians 3:26-28: Baptism unites believers in Christ, breaking down barriers of division.
#### Participation in the Death and Resurrection of Christ

Romans 6:4: "We were therefore buried with him through baptism into death in order that, just as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, we too may live a new life."
Baptism is a reminder of the new life believers have in Christ.
#### Anticipation of the Final Resurrection

Colossians 2:12: Baptism points forward to the hope of resurrection, reflecting the believer’s ultimate hope in Christ.
### Discussion Questions:

How does baptism reflect the gospel message of death, burial, and resurrection?

**For the Unbaptized:** Reflect on your faith journey. If you haven’t been baptized, consider taking this step as a declaration of your faith and obedience to Christ.

**For the Baptized:** Reflect on your baptism. How does it remind you of your identity in Christ and your new life in Him?

How can we encourage and support others in the group or church who are considering baptism.
