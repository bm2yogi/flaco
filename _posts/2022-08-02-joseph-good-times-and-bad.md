## Men's Discipleship Bible Study: Week 3
The account of Joseph is found in Genesis 37-50
## About Genesis:
Genesis and the four books that follow it are known as the Pentateuch, written by Moses around 1500 B.C. The events surrounding Joseph’s story took place around 1900 B.C. and were likely passed down through oral and/or written tradition until they were written in Genesis. Genesis is a historical book by nature, written for an ancient Hebrew audience.
## Background:
Jacob had more than one wife, but Rachel was his favorite. Joseph was the eleventh of the twelve sons born into Jacob’s family but the first born to Jacob and Rachel. As Jacob’s favorite son, Joseph enjoyed special favor and privilege in the family (symbolized by the special robe). As a result, he was hated by his brothers.
## Major Events in Joseph’s Life:
* Receives and shares prophetic dreams in which his brothers and parents bow down to him. (Gen 37:5-11)
* Sold into slavery by his own brothers who then tricked Jacob into thinking he’d been killed by a wild animal. (Gen 37:12-35)
* Bought by Potiphar, captain of the guard, in Egypt. God blessed everything Joseph did and Joseph was promoted to head over all in Potiphar’s house. (Gen 39:1-6)
* Falsely accused of attempting to rape Potiphar’s wife, thrown into “the king’s prison.” (Gen 39:6-20)
* God blessed everything Joseph did in prison and Joseph was placed in a position of authority in the prison. (Gen 39:20-23)
* Interpreted the prophetic dreams of Pharaoh’s cupbearer and baker. Remained imprisoned for 2 more years after pleading with the cupbearer to help get him out. (Gen 40:1-23)
* Interpreted 2 prophetic dreams of Pharaoh predicting a coming famine and after outlining a plan to Pharaoh, was appointed second in command in all of Egypt. (Gen 41:1-57)
* When his brothers came to Egypt looking to buy food during the famine, Joseph tested his brothers, accusing them of being spies. (Gen 42:1-44:34)
* He eventually revealed himself to his brothers as Joseph, proclaimed forgiveness and moved his whole family into Egypt. (Gen 45:1-47:12; Gen 50:20)
## For Discussion:
* More than once we read that the Lord was with Joseph and gave him success in everything he did. What did Joseph do to deserve such favor?
* What can we learn from Joseph’s response to his continued success?
* What did Joseph do to deserve the trials he went through?
* What can we learn from Joseph’s response to his continued trials?
* What stands out to you about Joseph’s response to Potiphar’s wife?
* What stands out to you about Joseph’s response to the baker and cupbearer when they asked for an interpretation to their dreams?
* What stands out to you about Joseph’s response when Pharaoh asked if Joseph would interpret his dream?
* How easy or hard was it for Joseph to show mercy and forgive his brothers instead of seizing the opportunity to get some payback? How do you think you'd have responded?
* What are the principles and virtues we see Joseph living by in this story? How can we build them into our own lives?
