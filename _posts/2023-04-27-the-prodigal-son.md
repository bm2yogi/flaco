### About the book of {{page.book}}:
The first four books of the New Testament (Matthew, Mark, Luke and John) are collectively known as the Gospels. They are a firsthand and secondhand account from eyewitnesses to Jesus’ life, ministry, death and resurrection. All evidence points to the gospels having been written as early as 41 AD, no later than 70 AD and set in Roman-occupied Israel and surrounding area. The gospels are historical records by nature, written for an ancient Hebrew audience.

The Gospel of Luke was written by Luke, who also authored the Book of Acts. Both writings are addressed to Theophilus at the beginning of each. 
According to the author, the book of Luke is an orderly account resulting from a careful investigation of the claims and events that occurred during Jesus' earthly ministry. Because the Gospel of Luke is historical in nature, its lessons can easily be understood by taking it at face value.
