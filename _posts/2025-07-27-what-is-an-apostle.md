## Men's Bible Study: {{page.title}}

### Overview
Apostle. It's one of those words we hear a lot in church talk and most of us probably take it for granted. When we hear 
the word apostle, we might think of Paul or Peter or the twelve disciples. We might also hear the term referring to
some modern-day figures in the church while others argue that apostleship ended long ago. How do we separate the truth 
from error? What does God have to say about it through His word as recorded in the Scriptures?

The word apostle and apostleship appear only in the New Testament. These words were translated from the original Greek
words apostolos and apostole which in the simplest terms means someone sent by another as a delegate for a task or mission.

#### Strongs Definitions:
_**ἀπόστολος apóstolos, ap-os'-tol-os;**_ from G649; a delegate; specially, an ambassador of the Gospel; officially a commissioner of Christ ("apostle") (with miraculous powers):—apostle, messenger, he that is sent.

**_ἀποστολή apostolḗ, ap-os-tol-ay';_** from G649; commission, i.e. (specially) apostolate:—apostleship.

#### First Use
Apostles are first mentioned in the Gospels:
> 1 Jesus called his twelve disciples to him and gave them authority to drive out impure spirits and to heal every disease and sickness. 2 These are the names of the twelve apostles: first, Simon (who is called Peter) and his brother Andrew; James son of Zebedee, and his brother John; 3 Philip and Bartholomew; Thomas and Matthew the tax collector; James son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus; 4 Simon the Zealot and Judas Iscariot, who betrayed him. - Matthew 10:1-4 NIV
> 
> 14 He appointed twelve that they might be with him and that he might send them out to preach 15 and to have authority to drive out demons. 16 These are the twelve he appointed: Simon (to whom he gave the name Peter), 17 James son of Zebedee and his brother John (to them he gave the name Boanerges, which means "sons of thunder"), 18 Andrew, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, James son of Alphaeus, Thaddaeus, Simon the Zealot 19 and Judas Iscariot, who betrayed him. - Mark 3:14-19 NIV
> 
> 12 One of those days Jesus went out to a mountainside to pray, and spent the night praying to God. 13 When morning came, he called his disciples to him and chose twelve of them, whom he also designated apostles: 14 Simon (whom he named Peter), his brother Andrew, James, John, Philip, Bartholomew, 15 Matthew, Thomas, James son of Alphaeus, Simon who was called the Zealot, 16 Judas son of James, and Judas Iscariot, who became a traitor. - Luke 6:12-16 NIV

We see here it was from among the disciples whom Jesus first appointed as apostles. What do we observe that 
sets them apart?

#### The Early Church
After the Resurrection:
> 16 Then the eleven disciples went to Galilee, to the mountain where Jesus had told them to go. 17 When they saw him, they worshiped him; but some doubted. 18 Then Jesus came to them and said, "All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me. 19 Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, 20 and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you. And surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age." - Matthew 28:16-20 NIV
> 
> 1 In my former book, Theophilus, I wrote about all that Jesus began to do and to teach 2 until the day he was taken up to heaven, after giving instructions through the Holy Spirit to the apostles he had chosen. - Acts 1:1-2 NIV
>
> 21 Therefore it is necessary to choose one of the men who have been with us the whole time the Lord Jesus was living among us, 22 beginning from John's baptism to the time when Jesus was taken up from us. For one of these must become a witness with us of his resurrection." 23 So they nominated two men: Joseph called Barsabbas (also known as Justus) and Matthias. 24 Then they prayed, "Lord, you know everyone's heart. Show us which of these two you have chosen 25 to take over this apostolic ministry, which Judas left to go where he belongs." 26 Then they cast lots, and the lot fell to Matthias; so he was added to the eleven apostles. - Acts 1:21-26 NIV
> 
> 42 They devoted themselves to the apostles' teaching and to fellowship, to the breaking of bread and to prayer. 43 Everyone was filled with awe at the many wonders and signs performed by the apostles. - Acts 2:42-43 NIV
>
> 2 So the Twelve gathered all the disciples together and said, "It would not be right for us to neglect the ministry of the word of God in order to wait on tables. 3 Brothers and sisters, choose seven men from among you who are known to be full of the Spirit and wisdom. We will turn this responsibility over to them 4 and will give our attention to prayer and the ministry of the word." 5 This proposal pleased the whole group. They chose Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Spirit; also Philip, Procorus, Nicanor, Timon, Parmenas, and Nicolas from Antioch, a convert to Judaism. 6 They presented these men to the apostles, who prayed and laid their hands on them. - Acts 6:2-6 NIV

What do we observe here that further sets the apostles apart from other disciples? What does Scripture tell us are
the qualifications for apostleship? What were the functions of the apostles in the early church?

#### Apostles...God's gift to the church
> 28 And God has placed in the church first of all apostles, second prophets, third teachers, then miracles, then gifts of healing, of helping, of guidance, and of different kinds of tongues. - 1 Corinthians 12:28 NIV
>
> 7 But to each one of us grace has been given as Christ apportioned it. ... 11 So Christ himself gave the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, the pastors and teachers, 12 to equip his people for works of service, so that the body of Christ may be built up 13 until we all reach unity in the faith and in the knowledge of the Son of God and become mature, attaining to the whole measure of the fullness of Christ. - Ephesians 4:7, 11-13 NIV
>
> 19 Consequently, you are no longer foreigners and strangers, but fellow citizens with God's people and also members of his household, 20 built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, with Christ Jesus himself as the chief cornerstone. 21 In him the whole building is joined together and rises to become a holy temple in the Lord. 22 And in him you too are being built together to become a dwelling in which God lives by his Spirit. - Ephesians 2:19-22 NIV

#### False Apostles and 
Not long after Christ's ascension, the early church had to contend with "false apostles" who infiltrated the church and
introduce false teachings and heresies...

> 3 But I am afraid that just as Eve was deceived by the serpent's cunning, your minds may somehow be led astray from your sincere and pure devotion to Christ. 4 For if someone comes to you and preaches a Jesus other than the Jesus we preached, or if you receive a different spirit from the Spirit you received, or a different gospel from the one you accepted, you put up with it easily enough. ... 12 And I will keep on doing what I am doing in order to cut the ground from under those who want an opportunity to be considered equal with us in the things they boast about. 13 For such people are ***false apostles***, deceitful workers, masquerading as apostles of Christ. 14 And no wonder, for Satan himself masquerades as an angel of light. 15 It is not surprising, then, if his servants also masquerade as servants of righteousness. Their end will be what their actions deserve. - 2 Corinthians 11:3-4, 12-15 NIV

To the Church in Ephesus:
> 2 I know your deeds, your hard work and your perseverance. I know that you cannot tolerate wicked people, that ***you have tested those who claim to be apostles but are not, and have found them false.*** - Revelation 2:2 NIV
