title: "Surrender: The Rich Young Ruler"

## Men's Bible Study: Week 4
The account of the rich young ruler is found in Matthew 19:16-30, Mark 10:17-31 and Luke 18:18-30.
### About the Gospels:
The first four books of the New Testament (Matthew, Mark, Luke and John) are collectively known as the Gospels. They are a firsthand and secondhand account from eyewitnesses to Jesus' life, ministry, death and resurrection.  All evidence points to the gospels having been written as early as 41 AD, no later than 70 AD and set in Roman-occupied Israel and surrounding area. The gospels are historical records by nature, written for an ancient Hebrew audience.
### Background:
Jesus and His disciples have been traveling throughout the region of Judea across the Jordan (Mark 10:1). As was often the case, he was followed by large crowds as well as teachers of The Law. He taught them, healed them and answered questions as he went along. The man in the account is described as wealthy in each account, young in Matthew's account and a ruler in Luke's account. The description of his wealth and piety, along with the title of ruler suggests he had administrative responsibilities in the local synagogue.  
### For Discussion:
* What does Scripture tell us about this synagogue ruler that made him different from some of the other synagogue rulers we encounter in the Gospels?
* Why did the rich young ruler approach Jesus? What was he hoping to hear from Jesus?
* What did Jesus offer him instead? What did Jesus require from him in return?
* Since Scripture teaches us that no one is justified by observing the law, but only by faith in Jesus Christ (Rom 3:30, Gal 2:15-16 & 3:11), why was Jesus' first response to the rich young ruler to point to The Law?
* What does the ruler's response to this tell us about how he perceived himself?
* What can we learn about the ruler by his response to Jesus' follow up command to sell everything, give to the poor, then follow Jesus?
* Of all the things Jesus could have asked of him, why this? Would selling his possessions and giving to the poor really have earned him eternal life?
* Contrast the ruler's response with that of Paul in Philippians 3:7-9.
* How would you respond if it were you? What is it in your life that you would back from Jesus if He asked you to give it up? (See Mark 10:29) What are you holding back now?
* What does this passage tell us about the difference between being a disciple and being a believer? Which of these does Jesus call us to?
