### Overview:
What do the Scriptures teach us about suffering?
To understand how Scripture presents suffering as part of God's will—not always as punishment, but often as a means of sanctification, witness, or spiritual formation.

### Suffering for Righteousness

> **1 Peter 3:17 (NIV)**  
> “For it is better, if it is God’s will, to suffer for doing good than for doing evil.”

> **1 Peter 4:19 (NIV)**  
> “So then, those who suffer according to God’s will should commit themselves to their faithful Creator and continue to do good.”

**Discussion**:
- Suffering can be the direct result of obedience.
- Believers are called to endure it as faithful witnesses.

### Suffering for Spiritual Growth

> **Romans 5:3–5 (NIV)**  
> “...suffering produces perseverance; perseverance, character; and character, hope.”

> **James 1:2–4 (NIV)**  
> “...the testing of your faith produces perseverance. Let perseverance finish its work...”

> **2 Corinthians 12:7–9 (NIV)**  
> “My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness.”

**Discussion**:
- God uses suffering to produce spiritual maturity and humility.
- Weakness becomes a platform for God's strength.

### Suffering for Witness and Ministry

> **Acts 9:15–16 (NIV)**  
> “I will show him how much he must suffer for my name.”

> **Philippians 1:29 (NIV)**  
> “...not only to believe in him, but also to suffer for him.”

> **Job 1:12; 2:6**  
> God allowed Job’s suffering to prove faith and silence Satan.

**Discussion**:
- Suffering can be part of God's plan to display His glory.
- It may position us to minister to others (2 Cor. 1:3–5).

### Suffering as Divine Discipline

> **Hebrews 12:6–11 (NIV)**  
> “The Lord disciplines the one he loves... it produces a harvest of righteousness and peace.”

**Discussion**:
- Not all suffering is punitive; it can be formative.
- God disciplines His children for their good.

### Christ’s Suffering as the Pattern

> **Isaiah 53:10 (NIV)**  
> “Yet it was the Lord’s will to crush him and cause him to suffer…”

> **Hebrews 5:8 (NIV)**  
> “Son though he was, he learned obedience from what he suffered.”

**Discussion**:
- Jesus’ suffering was redemptive and intentional.
- We follow in His footsteps (1 Peter 2:21).

### For Discussion:

1. In what ways have you experienced suffering as part of God’s work in your life?
2. How does understanding the purpose of suffering change your response to hardship?
3. Are there areas in your life where you need to trust God's will more fully in the midst of difficulty?
