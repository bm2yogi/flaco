## (Re)discovering the Purpose of Jesus' Ministry

### Overview
How often have you heard things like, "Jesus was a good teacher." "God just wants you to be happy." "Jesus came so we could
have a good/better life." "He came to teach us how to love one another." "Live your best life now." "He came to save us from ourselves." "He came
to get rid of suffering." There are lots of opinions both in and outside the church about this. While statements like 
this contain some truth, they fall short. What other things have you heard?

During His earthly ministry, Jesus made some very clear statements about what was His purpose in coming. As believers, 
disciples and disciple-makers, if we are to carry out the Great Commission and continue His work, don't you think we 
ought to be well acquainted and fully aligned with His mission and purpose?

#### Proclaim the Gospel
> 18 "The Spirit of the Lord is on me, because he has anointed me to proclaim good news to the poor. He has sent me to 
> proclaim freedom for the prisoners and recovery of sight for the blind, to set the oppressed free, 19 to proclaim the 
> year of the Lord's favor." 20 Then he rolled up the scroll, gave it back to the attendant and sat down. The eyes of 
> everyone in the synagogue were fastened on him. 21 He began by saying to them, "Today this scripture is fulfilled in 
> your hearing." - Luke 4:18-21 NIV

> 35 Very early in the morning, while it was still dark, Jesus got up, left the house and went off to a solitary place, 
> where he prayed. 36 Simon and his companions went to look for him, 37 and when they found him, they exclaimed: 
> "Everyone is looking for you!" 38 Jesus replied, "Let us go somewhere else--to the nearby villages--so I can preach 
> there also. That is why I have come." - Mark 1:35-38 NIV

> 43 But he said, "I must proclaim the good news of the kingdom of God to the other towns also, because that is why I 
> was sent." - Luke 4:43 NIV

> of him who sent me, that I shall lose none of all those he has given me, but raise them up at the last day. 40 For my 
> Father's will is that everyone who looks to the Son and believes in him shall have eternal life, and I will raise them 
> up at the last day." - John 6:38-40 NIV

#### To Save Us From God's Judgment
> 46 I have come into the world as a light, so that no one who believes in me should stay in darkness. 47 "If anyone
> hears my words but does not keep them, I do not judge that person. For I did not come to judge the world, but to save
> the world. 48 There is a judge for the one who rejects me and does not accept my words; the very words I have spoken
> will condemn them at the last day. 49 For I did not speak on my own, but the Father who sent me commanded me to say
> all that I have spoken. - John 12:46-49 NIV


#### To Lay Down His Life So That We Could Have Eternal Live
> 45 For even the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many." - Mark 10:45 NIV

> 10 The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy; I have come that they may have life, and have it to the full. - John 10:10 NIV
> 14 "I am the good shepherd; I know my sheep and my sheep know me-- 15 just as the Father knows me and I know the 
> Father--and I lay down my life for the sheep. 16 I have other sheep that are not of this sheep pen. I must bring them 
> also. They too will listen to my voice, and there shall be one flock and one shepherd. 17 The reason my Father loves 
> me is that I lay down my life--only to take it up again. 18 No one takes it from me, but I lay it down of my own 
> accord. I have authority to lay it down and authority to take it up again. This command I received from my Father." - John 10:14-18 NIV

#### To Proclaim to the Truth
> 37 "You are a king, then!" said Pilate. Jesus answered, "You say that I am a king. In fact, the reason I was born and 
> came into the world is to testify to the truth. Everyone on the side of truth listens to me." - John 18:37 NIV

> 6 Jesus answered, "I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me. - John 14:6 NIV

#### To Fulfill the Requirements of the Law
> 17 "Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill 
> them. - Matthew 5:17 NIV

#### To Bring Glory to God
> 1 After Jesus said this, he looked toward heaven and prayed: "Father, the hour has come. Glorify your Son, that your 
> Son may glorify you. 2 For you granted him authority over all people that he might give eternal life to all those you 
> have given him. 3 Now this is eternal life: that they know you, the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom you have 
> sent. 4 I have brought you glory on earth by finishing the work you gave me to do. 5 And now, Father, glorify me in 
> your presence with the glory I had with you before the world began. - John 17:1-5 NIV
