### We are Saved by Faith and NOT observing the Law
> 19 "For through the law I died to the law so that I might live for God. 20 I have been crucified with Christ and I no 
> longer live, but Christ lives in me. The life I now live in the body, I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved 
> me and gave himself for me. 21 I do not set aside the grace of God, for if righteousness could be gained through the 
> law, Christ died for nothing!" - Galatians 2:19-21 NIV

> 8 What is more, I consider everything a loss because of the surpassing worth of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord, for 
> whose sake I have lost all things. I consider them garbage, that I may gain Christ 9 and be found in him, not having 
> a righteousness of my own that comes from the law, but that which is through faith in Christ--the righteousness that 
> comes from God on the basis of faith. - Philippians 3:8-9 NIV

### We are Saved by Faith and NOT Works
> 15 We who are Jews by birth and not sinful Gentiles 16 know that a person is not justified by the works of the law,
> but by faith in Jesus Christ. So we, too, have put our faith in Christ Jesus that we may be justified by faith in
> Christ and not by the works of the law, because by the works of the law no one will be justified. - Galatians
> 2:15-16 NIV

### Works are Evidence of Faith
>14 What good is it, my brothers and sisters, if someone claims to have faith but has no deeds? Can such faith save 
> them? 15 Suppose a brother or a sister is without clothes and daily food. 16 If one of you says to them, "Go in 
> peace; keep warm and well fed," but does nothing about their physical needs, what good is it? 17 In the same way, 
> faith by itself, if it is not accompanied by action, is dead. 18 But someone will say, "You have faith; I have 
> deeds." Show me your faith without deeds, and I will show you my faith by my deeds. 19 You believe that there is one 
> God. Good! Even the demons believe that--and shudder. 20 You foolish person, do you want evidence that faith without 
> deeds is useless? 21 Was not our father Abraham considered righteous for what he did when he offered his son Isaac on 
> the altar? 22 You see that his faith and his actions were working together, and his faith was made complete by what 
> he did. 23 And the scripture was fulfilled that says, "Abraham believed God, and it was credited to him as 
> righteousness," and he was called God's friend. 24 You see that a person is considered righteous by what they do and 
> not by faith alone. 25 In the same way, was not even Rahab the prostitute considered righteous for what she did when 
> she gave lodging to the spies and sent them off in a different direction? 26 As the body without the spirit is dead, 
> so faith without deeds is dead. - James 2:14-26 NIV

> 20 First to those in Damascus, then to those in Jerusalem and in all Judea, and then to the Gentiles, I preached that 
> they should repent and turn to God and demonstrate their repentance by their deeds. - Acts 26:20 NIV

### Salvation by Grace Through Faith
In Paul's letter to the Ephesian church, we're taught that our salvation comes to us as a result of God's grace and not 
works. We receive this salvation through faith, but it is only because God's grace makes it possible. Without God's grace
would our faith have any effect?
> 8 For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith--and this is not from yourselves, it is the gift of God-- 9 
> not by works, so that no one can boast. - Ephesians 2:8-9 NIV

### Bonus: Are We Saved by Water Baptism?
> 18 For Christ also suffered once for sins, the righteous for the unrighteous, to bring you to God. He was put to 
> death in the body but made alive in the Spirit. 19 After being made alive, he went and made proclamation to the 
> imprisoned spirits-- 20 to those who were disobedient long ago when God waited patiently in the days of Noah while 
> the ark was being built. In it only a few people, eight in all, were saved through water, 21 and this water 
> symbolizes baptism that now saves you also--not the removal of dirt from the body but the pledge of a clear 
> conscience toward God. It saves you by the resurrection of Jesus Christ, 22 who has gone into heaven and is at God's 
> right hand--with angels, authorities and powers in submission to him. - 1 Peter 3:18-22 NIV
