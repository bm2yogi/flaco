### We are Saved by Faith and NOT observing the Law
> 19 "For through the law I died to the law so that I might live for God. 20 I have been crucified with Christ and I no 
> longer live, but Christ lives in me. The life I now live in the body, I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved 
> me and gave himself for me. 21 I do not set aside the grace of God, for if righteousness could be gained through the 
> law, Christ died for nothing!" - Galatians 2:19-21 NIV

> 8 What is more, I consider everything a loss because of the surpassing worth of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord, for 
> whose sake I have lost all things. I consider them garbage, that I may gain Christ 9 and be found in him, not having 
> a righteousness of my own that comes from the law, but that which is through faith in Christ--the righteousness that 
> comes from God on the basis of faith. - Philippians 3:8-9 NIV

### We are Saved by Faith and NOT Works
> 15 We who are Jews by birth and not sinful Gentiles 16 know that a person is not justified by the works of the law,
> but by faith in Jesus Christ. So we, too, have put our faith in Christ Jesus that we may be justified by faith in
> Christ and not by the works of the law, because by the works of the law no one will be justified. - Galatians
> 2:15-16 NIV

### What is Faith?
Hebrews 11 describes faith as follows and then is packed with examples of men and women who demonstrated real faith by
their obedience and action.
> 1 Now faith is confidence in what we hope for and assurance about what we do not see. 2 This is what the ancients 
> were commended for. ... 6 And without faith it is impossible to please God, because anyone who comes to him must 
> believe that he exists and that he rewards those who earnestly seek him. - Hebrews 11:1-2, 6 NIV

### Works are Evidence of Faith
>14 What good is it, my brothers and sisters, if someone claims to have faith but has no deeds? Can such faith save 
> them? 15 Suppose a brother or a sister is without clothes and daily food. 16 If one of you says to them, "Go in 
> peace; keep warm and well fed," but does nothing about their physical needs, what good is it? 17 In the same way, 
> faith by itself, if it is not accompanied by action, is dead. 18 But someone will say, "You have faith; I have 
> deeds." Show me your faith without deeds, and I will show you my faith by my deeds. 19 You believe that there is one 
> God. Good! Even the demons believe that--and shudder. 20 You foolish person, do you want evidence that faith without 
> deeds is useless? 21 Was not our father Abraham considered righteous for what he did when he offered his son Isaac on 
> the altar? 22 You see that his faith and his actions were working together, and his faith was made complete by what 
> he did. 23 And the scripture was fulfilled that says, "Abraham believed God, and it was credited to him as 
> righteousness," and he was called God's friend. 24 You see that a person is considered righteous by what they do and 
> not by faith alone. 25 In the same way, was not even Rahab the prostitute considered righteous for what she did when 
> she gave lodging to the spies and sent them off in a different direction? 26 As the body without the spirit is dead, 
> so faith without deeds is dead. - James 2:14-26 NIV

> 20 First to those in Damascus, then to those in Jerusalem and in all Judea, and then to the Gentiles, I preached that 
> they should repent and turn to God and demonstrate their repentance by their deeds. - Acts 26:20 NIV

### Salvation by Grace Through Faith
> 8 For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith--and this is not from yourselves, it is the gift of God-- 9 
> not by works, so that no one can boast. - Ephesians 2:8-9 NIV

> 9 He has saved us and called us to a holy life--not because of anything we have done but because of his own purpose 
> and grace. This grace was given us in Christ Jesus before the beginning of time, - 2 Timothy 1:9 NIV

> 5 he saved us, not because of righteous things we had done, but because of his mercy. He saved us through the washing 
> of rebirth and renewal by the Holy Spirit, - Titus 3:5 NIV

> 16 For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but 
> have eternal life. - John 3:16 NIV

Here we see that our salvation comes to us as a result of God's grace and not works. We receive our salvation through 
faith, but it is only because God's grace makes it possible. Without God's grace would our faith have any effect?

### Grace is Invalidated by Works
> 5 So too, at the present time there is a remnant chosen by grace. 6 And if by grace, then it cannot be based on 
> works; if it were, grace would no longer be grace. - Romans 11:5-6 NIV

> 2 If, in fact, Abraham was justified by works, he had something to boast about--but not before God. 3 What does 
> Scripture say? "Abraham believed God, and it was credited to him as righteousness." 4 Now to the one who works, 
> wages are not credited as a gift but as an obligation. 5 However, to the one who does not work but trusts God who 
> justifies the ungodly, their faith is credited as righteousness. - Romans 4:2-5 NIV

If Grace is invalidated by works, can we correctly consider faith to be a "work?" How about repentance? If faith or 
repentance is to be considered a work, then they logically must invalidate grace.

### Bonus: Are We Saved by Water Baptism?
> 18 For Christ also suffered once for sins, the righteous for the unrighteous, to bring you to God. He was put to 
> death in the body but made alive in the Spirit. 19 After being made alive, he went and made proclamation to the 
> imprisoned spirits-- 20 to those who were disobedient long ago when God waited patiently in the days of Noah while 
> the ark was being built. In it only a few people, eight in all, were saved through water, 21 and this water 
> symbolizes baptism that now saves you also--not the removal of dirt from the body but the pledge of a clear 
> conscience toward God. It saves you by the resurrection of Jesus Christ, 22 who has gone into heaven and is at God's 
> right hand--with angels, authorities and powers in submission to him. - 1 Peter 3:18-22 NIV
