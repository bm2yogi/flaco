title: We Ain't Cancelling Moms and Dads
---
## Opportunity:
We have an opportunity to introduce local mothers and fathers of elementary age children to Jesus, the Pursuit community and Pursuit Elementary School after a local elementary school has cancelled this year's Mothers' and Fathers' day events citing "inclusivity" concerns and a desire to "avoiding triggering" students.

## Background:
On 4/19/2023, the Post-Millennial published a story in which the Riverview Elementary School in Snohomish has canceled Mother’s Day and Father’s Day events to avoid "triggers" for students, however the same school is promoting the upcoming Snohomish LGBTQ+ Pride event featuring a drag show.

At a PTO meeting on 4/11, the school Principal (Derek Larsen) informed the PTO that the school decided to eliminate the "Moms and Maple Bars" and "Dad's and Donuts" events and replace it with a "Donuts with Grownups" event.

According to meeting minutes, many parents voiced their displeasure.

When this came to the attention of our Mens' Discipleship Small Group, many of us were moved and agreed we need to do something. We want to push back against the ideology that seeks to diminish the importance of mothers and fathers in the home and in the community. As men of God we want to honor, support and stand alongside mothers, fathers and their families.

## Proposal:
We want to invite the mothers and fathers of Riverview Elementary School students to be our honored guests at our own "Moms & Maplebars" and "Dads & Donuts" events.
We want to communicate clearly and unequivocally that there's a community of people who are equally displeased with the school's decision to diminish their value as mothers and fathers. A community that wants to stand with them and wants to love and honor them and their children.
Time is of the essence because Mothers' Day is in less than 3 weeks.

### When
May 11 at or around 6:30 and June 8 at or around 6:30.
The original events were scheduled for the mornings of May 11 and June 8. We'd like to use these dates because they were likely already on the parents' minds and to make an intentional point to the school board.
We'd like to use this time of 6:30pm so that more working mothers and fathers will be able to attend with their children after work and after school.

### Where
We want to use this event as a way to invite the parents and children to join us at Pursuit and come to know Jesus.
The Pursuit Snohomish campus is an ideal location because it is within 4 miles of the school and therefore close to where the parents and students live.
It is also ideal because it will introduce attendees to the people of our church and the campus.
The main sanctuary is suitable for large gatherings and serving food.

### Promotion
In addition to the usual Social Media activities, we'd like to print flyers and ask supportive local businesses to post them for their customers to see. Coffee shops, restaruants, ice cream shops and anywhere else a parent with elementary school children might go.

### Speaker
We'd like one of our pastors to address the parents and children.

## Additional Info:
The "Donuts with Grownups" is scheduled for May 23, 24 and 25 from 7:45-8:15am in the school cafeteria.

The this year's events were originally scheduled for May 11 and June 8. In 2018, the events were held on campus at 8am.

There is a school board meeting for Riverview Elementary on Wednesday 4/26. It is open to the public. Here's the link to the [agenda.](https://www.sno.wednet.edu/cms/lib/WA01919489/Centricity/domain/131/board%20agendas/01%20Agenda%204-26-2023.pdf)

Riverview Elementary has approximately 560 children enrolled via grades K-6 and is located approximately 4 miles from the Pursuit Snohomish campus.
The district roughly is bounded by the Snohimish River to the west and south, Hwy 2 to the north and Hwy 9/Avenue D to the east.
