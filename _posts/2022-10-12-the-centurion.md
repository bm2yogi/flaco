title: The Centurion at Capernaum
---
## Men's Discipleship Bible Study: Week 6
The account of the Centurion is found in Matthew 8:5-13 and Luke 7:1-10.
### About the Gospels:
The first four books of the New Testament (Matthew, Mark, Luke and John) are collectively known as the Gospels. They are a firsthand and secondhand account from eyewitnesses to Jesus' life, ministry, death and resurrection.  All evidence points to the gospels having been written as early as 41 AD, no later than 70 AD and set in Roman-occupied Israel and surrounding area. The gospels are historical records by nature, written for an ancient Hebrew audience.
### Background:
Jesus and His disciples have been traveling and teaching throughout the region and had now just entered Capernaum, where Jesus settled and dwelt when He started His ministry (Matthew 4:13). As was often the case, He was followed by large crowds as well as teachers of The Law. He taught them, healed them and answered questions as He went along. The man in the account is described as a "centurion", a commander of around one-hundred soldiers in the Roman army.
