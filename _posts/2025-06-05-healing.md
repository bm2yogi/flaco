### Is Supernatural Healing Still a Thing?
Christians generally fall into one of two camps on the subject of whether God still heals 
people today or whether the spiritual gift of healing ended after the last of the apostles died.
#### Cessationists
Cessationists believe that miraculous signs like supernatural healing, ceased after the death of 
the apostles and the completion of the New Testament canon. They hold that miracles were for the 
specific purpose of authenticating the apostles and for the specific time needed to establish the 
early Church. They hold that once Scripture was completed and the Church was founded, these gifts were
no longer needed. They may admit that God may still heal, but not by the Holy Spirit moving through individuals.

#### Continuationists
Continuationists believe that all spiritual gifts, including healing, are still active and available 
to the church today as part of the ongoing work of the Holy Spirit. Asserting there is no clear Scripture 
stating that miraculous gifts have ceased, they hold to the idea that the gifts of the Holy Spirit are given 
for the continuing building up of the Church and the advancement of the gospel. They profess that healing occurs 
through individuals as the Holy Spirit wills.

Within the continuationist camp, there are some who teach that physical healing is a promised right or privilege of 
all believers purchased through Christ's atonement. Among these, there is the debate of whether healing depends on
the faith of the one to be healed, the righteousness of the one to be healed, the will or sovereignty of God
or a combination of the above.

### So Who's Right and Who's Wrong?
To come to a reliable answer, we must first look to the Scriptures and not the ***opinions of others about*** the Scriptures.
After having done so, we must then look through the lens of Scripture to understand what we are seeing today when it comes to 
the question of divine healing.

### For Discussion:
After studying these passages,
1. What was the purpose of the healing? What outcome did it produce?
2. What do they all have in common? In what ways are they different?
3. What can we conclude about the people being healed? What can we conclude about the people through whom the healing comes?
4. Are there any special words or phrases that must be used?
5. Was there anyone who was only partially healed? Can we find any Scripture to support "partial healing?"
6. Was there anyone who was healed but then lost their healing? Can we find any Scripture to support "losing your healing?"
7. Was there anyone who received "the ultimate healing" (aka died)?
