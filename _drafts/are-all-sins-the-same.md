title: Are All Sins The Same?
---
Why do Christians make a big deal out of some sins, but not others? Why are sins like divorce tolerated but homosexuality and abortion not okay?

Have you ever been asked this question by a non-believer or maybe wondered yourself?

On one hand, God says through his Word that anyone who breaks the law in one area is guilty of breaking all of it.
