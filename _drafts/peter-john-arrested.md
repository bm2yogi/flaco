### About {{page.book}}:
The book of Acts was written by Luke, who also authored the Gospel of Luke. Both writings are addressed to Theophilus at
the beginning of each. The book of Acts chronicles the events and activities of the apostles and the early church 
immediately following the crucifixion, resurrection and ascension of Jesus. Because Acts is historical in nature, its 
lessons can easily be understood by taking it at face value. 

Acts is assumed to have been originally written as early as just 30 years after Jesus ministry on earth, between 
62-70 A.D. It stands to reason that a meticulous historian like Luke would have at least included the martyrdom of 
James (62 A.D.), Peter (64 A.D.), Paul (67 A.D.) or even the destruction of Jerusalem in 70 A.D. Since none of these 
events are recorded, it is almost certain the authorship took place before these events.

### Background:
Acts 4 records the events immediately following a miracle in which God used Peter and John to heal a 40-year-old beggar 
who was lame from birth and was now walking, jumping and praising God. A crowd had gathered around and Peter seized this 
opportunity to deliver the gospel message to all present. The number of Jews coming to faith in Christ is growing 
rapidly as Jesus' disciples are busy fulfilling the Great Commission, much to the dismay of the spiritual and political 
authorities of the day.
