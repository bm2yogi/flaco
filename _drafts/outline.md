## Men's Bible Study
### Goal
Men discipling one another into Christ-centered relationships, in which the Holy Spirit empowers them to be the fathers, 
sons, husbands, disciplemakers and leaders in the church and in the home He designed them to be.

### What it looks like
Under the spiritual covering of the local church, several men's small groups meet monthly in various locations around 
the area. In these small groups, the men are devoted to prayer, fellowship, teachings of Scripture, Biblical literacy, 
and breaking bread together. The time and locations of the small groups are published on the church website.

The groups are purposed towards bringing men deeper into the presence of God in their daily lives. Being grounded in 
sound doctrine, connecting to the Holy Spirit through prayer and to one another through intercession and fellowship.

The leaders of each group meet together monthly to pray for one another, our pastors, our church, and the men in their 
respective groups. The topics for these groups are topical and character studies designed to make clear God's intention 
and purpose for the man of God.

The leaders of each group look for one or two members of their group to mentor into leaders of their own groups.

### Who it's for
These small groups are for adult men of any age and any stage of spiritual growth. It will also be an avenue for men to 
introduce their "unchurched" friends to Jesus and begin making connections with other believers.

### Other details
Connect the men of the church via private social media groups for events, announcements, curated content and on-line 
community.
