Greetings, men.

Please allow me to encourage you with this:

> 12 Indeed all who desire to live a godly life in Christ Jesus will be persecuted, 13 while evil men and impostors will go on from bad to worse, deceivers and deceived. 14 But as for you, continue in what you have learned and have firmly believed, knowing from whom you learned it - 2 Timothy 3:12-14 RSV

The enemy hates it when you stand uncompromisingly on God's truth. He hates you and your family and will seek to turn your family against you in any way he can. The pressure to compromise and bow to the culture will be great. Men of God, you must hold the line. So much counts on this. Lead your family in His ways. Never stop praying for your family.

In the last several days, our family has been under a series of attack that I'm convinced is a spiritual battle. I've had some horrible things said about me. Mingled in with these attacks on my character have been a twisting of God's Word and what I believe.

My family and I are convinced that the intensity of this attack is a sign of a great testimony on the other end. We're convinced that God is walking us through this painful time to build into us the strength we need for the next call he has on our lives. We're convinced that God is good and He works all things for His glory. Even when we can't see the end, He is already there and we just haven't yet caught up. We are not asking God to take away the trial, pain and suffering. We are thanking Him for the opportunity to see Him work His glory through it all.

Men, dive deep to become men of His Word. Be holy and pure. Pray for and serve your family without ceasing. Be self-disciplined and on alert. Resist the urge to compromise on what is right. Lean on God. Lean also on your brothers for the strength to persevere. Never quit.
