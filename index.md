# Welcome to Table 22
Godly men are in short supply at a time when they are needed the most. Too many men have abdicated their God-given responsibilities and the world is paying the price. The principles and virtues that were once table stakes for being considered a man have been replaced with passivity, weakness, selfishness, intemperance, compromise, and cowardice.

The resulting devastation has been overwhelming. Our children deal with depression, addiction, self-harm and suicide in staggering numbers. They are targets and victims of destruction, mutilation, and sexual deviance and disorder like never before in recent memory. Our families, our marriages, even the glorious distinctions that make men and women different, unique and significant are under attack.

Generations of men, like myself, have grown up without fathers. Some of us have been fortunate enough to have had godly men appointed into our lives for seasons. Men whoâ€™ve taught us what it means to be men of God. Therefore, it is our solemn and holy obligation to now be that man for our brothers and the next generation. 

**We are to be more than believers and more than disciples. We are commanded to be disciple-makers.**

## Our Vision
Men living spiritually strong and free, surrendered completely to the lordship of Jesus, being discipled, and discipling one another. Together being transformed into the husbands, fathers, sons, disciple-makers and leaders in both the church and in the home He desires us to be.
